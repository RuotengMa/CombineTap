# CombineTap

CombineTap, a system that allows users to
perform complicated tasks with single taps, and provides a
simple way to create buttons that allow these tasks to be performed.
CombineTap uses a RGB video camera to detect
user interactions on custom designed, printed or hand-drawn
markers that act like buttons when placed in the view of the
camera. Users can define custom patterns for their buttons,
and combine these patterns in certain ways that a single marker
can perform the combined actions of all the patterns it contains.
This allows users to quickly create shortcut buttons for
any combination of actions. Once a pattern is recognized and
associated with an action, it can be reused in new markers
without the need of reintroducing the association. With
CombineTap, a LaTex user using TeXstudio can combine the
marker patterns for Ctrl, Shift and Up buttons into a single
button that performs the keystroke combination of ’Ctrl + Shift + Up’. When the user taps this custom button during editing,
TeXstudio receives the keystroke combination and goes to the
next LaTex error automatically.
